BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT

This directory contains the web app source.
For deployment, it needs to be built with Apache Ant.
The only requirements are JDK >=1.3 and Ant >=1.5.

Run "build.bat" in this directory for available targets (e.g. "build.bat build",
"build.bat warfile"). Note that to start Ant this way, you'll need an XML parser
in your classpath (e.g. in "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/ext"; included in JDK 1.4).
You can use "warfile.bat" as a shortcut for WAR file creation.
The WAR file will be created in the "dist" directory.
