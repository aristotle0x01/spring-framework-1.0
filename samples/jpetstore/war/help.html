      <H1>JPetStore Demo</H1>
      <H3>By <a href="mailto:clinton.begin@ibatis.com">Clinton Begin</a></H3></CENTER>The JPetStore Demo
      is an online pet store. Like most e-stores, you can browse and search the
      product catalog, choose items to add to a shopping cart, amend the
      shopping cart, and order the items in the shopping cart. You can perform
      many of these actions without registering with or logging into the
      application. However, before you can order items you must log in (sign in)
      to the application. In order to sign in, you must have an account with the
      application, which is created when you register (sign up) with the
      application.

      <H2><A name=Catalog></A>Working with the Product Catalog</H2>This section
      describes how to browse and search the product catalog.
      <H4><A name=CatalogBrowsing></A>Browsing the Catalog</H4>The pet store
      catalog is organized hierarchically as follows: categories, products,
      items.
      <P>You list the pets in a category by clicking on the category name in the
      left column of the main page, or by clicking on the picture representing
      the category.
      <P>Once you select a category, the pet store will display a list of
      products within a category. Selecting a product displays a list of items
      and their prices. Selecting a product item displays a text and visual
      description of the item and the number of that item in stock.
      <H4><A name=CatalogSearching></A>Searching the Catalog</H4>You search for
      products by typing the product name in search field in the middle of the
      banner.
      <H2><A name=ShoppingCart></A>Working with the Shopping Cart</H2>
      <H4><A name=ShoppingCartAdd></A>Adding and Removing Items</H4>You add an
      item to your shopping cart by clicking the Add to Cart button to the right
      of an item. This action also displays your shopping cart.
      <P>You can remove the item by clicking the Remove button to the left of
      the item.
      <P>To continue shopping, you select a product category from the list under
      the banner.

      Item</H4>You adjust the quantity of an item by typing the quantity in the
      item's Quantity field in the shopping cart and clicking the Update button.

      <P>If the quantity of items requested is greater than that in stock, the
      In Stock field in the shopping cart will show that the item is
      backordered.
      <H4><A name=Ordering></A>Ordering Items</H4>You order the items in the
      shopping cart by selecting the Proceed to Checkout button. The pet store
      will display a read-only list of the shopping cart contents. To proceed
      with the checkout, click the Continue button.
      <P>If you have not signed in, the application will display the signin
      page, where you will need to provide your account name and password.
      Otherwise, the application will display a page requesting payment and
      shipping information. When you have filled in the required information,
      you click the Submit button, and the application will display a read-only
      page containing your billing and shipping address.&nbsp; If you need to
      change any information, click your browser's Back button and enter the
      correct information. To complete the order, you click the Continue button.

      deployed. See the installation instructions for further information.
