1. BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT

This directory contains the web app source.
For deployment, it needs to be built with Apache Ant.
The only requirements are JDK >=1.3 and Ant >=1.5.

Run "build.bat" in this directory for available targets (e.g. "build.bat build",
"build.bat warfile"). Note that to start Ant this way, you'll need an XML parser
in your classpath (e.g. in "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/ext"; included in JDK 1.4).
You can use "warfile.bat" as a shortcut for WAR file creation.
The WAR file will be created in the "dist" directory.

Note on enabling Log4J:
- Log4J is disabled by default, due to JBoss issues
- drop a log4j.jar into the deployed war/WEB-INF/lib directory
- uncomment the root category in war/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties
- uncomment the Log4J listener in war/WEB-INF/web.xml


2. SCENARIOS

Default scenario
----------------

The application is configured for the first scenario, generating data
in memory. This will normally run as-is in most application servers.

Moving to scenario 2
--------------------
This scenario will use the memoryDao like the first.
But, in addition, it will set a secondary databaseDao.
So, you will be able, using the application, to read the data from
the memoryDao and write into the databaseDao.
The main goal of this scenario is to put the countries data in your database.

Two databases have been tested: HSQLDB and MySQL.
Switching from one to the other is only a matter of mapping the right database
to the application known JNDI location.

Now that the server is set up, we will change the application configuration.
Just two little changes have to be made.
1) in war/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml: comment the scenario 1 and uncomment the 2.
You are so just defining a "secondDaoCountry" bean and its "dataSource" bean.
2) in war/WEB-INF/countries-servlet.xml: uncomment the property "secondDaoCountry"
near the end of the file.

Now that all is set, rebuild the war file with the ant command and deploy the 
new generated war file.

Test the application, and go to the new choice "Copy". A message tell you about 
the work. If you see that the data were not copied, you will have to check the logs.

Moving to scenario 3
--------------------
This is the ultimate goal. You come back to using only one DAO, but you use the
database one instead the memory one as in the first scenario.
1) in war/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml: comment the scenario 2 and uncomment the 3.
You just pick up the configuration of your previously "secondDaoCountry" to put 
them as primary DAO. You don't need anymore a second Dao.
2) in war/WEB-INF/countries-servlet.xml: re-comment the property "secondDaoCountry"
near the end of the file as you don't have any.

Now, once more, rebuild the war file with the ant command and deploy the 
new generated war file.

You don't have the 'copy' choice, because the application checks the configuration 
and allow this only when a secondDao of 'DATABASE' type is detected.

And then ?
----------
It rest to look at the sources and configuration to study and understand what you
made and how. 
This demo uses just a few Jdbc capabilities of Spring, mainly to demonstrate 
the simple switching between two DAOs implementing the same interface.
For the rest, the focus is on the web part of the framework. Nevertheless, the
current demo doesn't show the user input nor the validation process.
