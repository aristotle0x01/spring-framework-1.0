/**
 * Extension of the BeanFactory interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their beans (for example, DOM-based XML factories) may implement
 * this interface. This interface is discussed in "Expert One-on-One J2EE Design
 * and Development", by Rod Johnson.
 *
 * <p>If this is a HierarchicalBeanFactory, the return values will <i>not</i> take
 * any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans defined
 * in the current factory. Use the BeanFactoryUtils helper class to get all beans.
 * 
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * ConfigurableBeanFactory's registerSingleton. Use BeanFactory's methods to access such
 * beans. In typical scenarios, all beans will be defined by bean definitions anyway.
 *
 * <p>With the exception of getBeanDefinitionCount(), the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
