/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that hold a number of bean definitions,
 * each uniquely identified by a String name. An independent instance of any of
 * these objects can be obtained (the Prototype design pattern), or a single
 * shared instance can be obtained (a superior alternative to the Singleton
 * design pattern). Which type of instance will be returned depends on the bean
 * factory configuration - the API is the same. The Singleton approach is much
 * more useful and more common in practice.
 *
 * <p>The point of this approach is that the BeanFactory is a central registry
 * of application components, and centralizes the configuring of application
 * components (no more do individual objects need to read properties files,
 * for example). See chapters 4 and 11 of "Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and
 * Development" for a discussion of the benefits of this approach.
 *
 * <p>Normally a BeanFactory will load bean definitions stored in a configuration
 * source (such as an XML document), and use the org.springframework.beans package
 * to configure the beans. However, an implementation could simply return Java
 * objects it creates as necessary directly in Java code. There are no constraints
 * on how the definitions could be stored: LDAP, RDBMS, XML, properties file etc.
 * Implementations are encouraged to support references amongst beans, to either
 * Singletons or Prototypes.
 *
 * <p>In contrast to the methods in ListableBeanFactory, all of the methods in this
 * interface will also check parent factories if this is a HierarchicalBeanFactory.
 * If a bean is not found in this factory instance, the immediate parent is asked.
 * Beans in this factory instance are supposed to override beans of the same name
 * in any parent factory.
 *
 * <p>Bean factories are supposed to support the standard bean lifecycle interfaces
 * as far as possible. The maximum set of initialization methods and their standard
 * order is:<br>
 * 1. BeanNameAware's setBeanName<br>
 * 2. BeanFactoryAware's setBeanFactory<br>
 * 3. ApplicationContextAware's setApplicationContext (only applicable if running
 * in an application context)<br>
 * 4. postProcessBeforeInitialization methods of BeanPostProcessors<br>
 * 5. InitializingBean's afterPropertiesSet<br>
 * 6. a custom init-method definition<br>
 * 7. postProcessAfterInitialization methods of BeanPostProcessors
 *
 * <p>On shutdown of a bean factory, the following lifecycle methods apply:<br>
 * 1. DisposableBean's destroy<br>
 * 2. a custom destroy-method definition
