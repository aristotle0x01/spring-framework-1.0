/**
 * <p>An interface for a class used to lookup/use, and optionally allow the
 * release of a BeanFactory, or BeanFactory subclass such as ApplicationContext.
 *
 * <p>Where this interface is implemented as a singleton class such as
 * SingletonBeanFactoryLocator, the Spring team <strong>strongly</strong>
 * suggests that it be used sparingly and with caution. By far the vast majority
 * of the code inside an application is best written in a Dependency Injection
 * style, where that code is served out of a BeanFactory/ApplicationContext
 * container, and has its own dependencies supplied by the container when it is
 * created. However, even such a singleton implementation sometimes has its use
 * in the small glue layers of code that is sometimes needed to tie other code
 * together. For example, third party code may try to construct new objects
 * directly, without the ability to force it to get these objects out of a 
 * beanfactory. If the object constructed by the third party code is just a
 * small stub or proxy, which then uses an implementation of this class to get a
 * beanfactory from which it gets the real object, to which it delegates, then 
 * proper Dependency Injection has been achieved. As another example, in a complex
 * J2EE app with multiple layers, with each layer having its own
 * ApplicationContext definition (in a hierarchy), a class like
 * SingletonBeanFactoryLocator may be used to demand load these contexts.
