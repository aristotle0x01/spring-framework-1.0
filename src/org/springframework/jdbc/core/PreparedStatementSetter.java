 * Callback interface used by the JdbcTemplate class.

 * <p>This interface sets values on a PreparedStatement provided by the
 * JdbcTemplate class. Implementations are responsible for setting any
 * necessary parameters. SQL with placeholders will already have been supplied.
 *
 * <p>It's easier to use this interface than PreparedStatementCreator,
 * as the JdbcTemplate will create the prepared statement.
 *
 * <p>Implementations <i>do not</i> need to concern themselves with
 * SQLExceptions that may be thrown from operations they attempt.
 * The JdbcTemplate class will catch and handle SQLExceptions appropriately.
