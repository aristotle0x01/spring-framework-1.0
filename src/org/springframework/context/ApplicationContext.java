/** 
 * Central interface to provide configuration for an application.
 * This is read-only while the application is running, but may be
 * reloaded if the implementation supports this.
 *
 * <p>An ApplicationContext provides:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bean factory methods, inherited from ListableBeanFactory.
 * This avoids the need for applications to use singletons.
 * <li>The ability to resolve messages, supporting internationalization.
 * Inherited from the MessageSource interface.
 * <li>The ability to load file resources in a generic fashion.
 * Inherited from the ResourceLoader interface.
 * <li>The ability to publish events. Implementations must provide a means
 * of registering event listeners.
 * <li>Inheritance from a parent context. Definitions in a descendant context
 * will always take priority. This means, for example, that a single parent
 * context can be used by an entire web application, while each servlet has
 * its own child context that is independent of that of any other servlet.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition to standard bean factory lifecycle capabilities,
 * ApplicationContext implementations need to detect ApplicationContextAware
 * beans and invoke the setApplicationContext method accordingly.
