/**
 * Base Controller interface, representing a component that receives HttpServletRequest
 * and HttpServletResponse like a <code>HttpServlet</code> but is able to participate in
 * an MVC workflow. Comparable to the notion of a Struts <code>Action</code>
 *
 * <p>Any implementation of the Controller interface should be a
 * <i>reusable, threadsafe</i> class, capable of handling multiple
 * HTTP requests throughout the lifecycle of an application. To be able to
 * configure Controller in an easy, Controllers are usually JavaBeans.</p>
 *
 * <p><b><a name="workflow">Workflow</a>:</b><br>
 * After the DispatcherServlet has received a request and has done its work
 * to resolve locales, themes and things a like, it tries to resolve
 * a Controller, using a {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerMapping
 * HandlerMapping}. When a Controller has been found, the \
 * {@link #handleRequest(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) handleRequest()}
 * method will be invoked, which is responsible for handling the actual
 * request and - if applicable - returning an appropriate ModelAndView.
 * So actually, this method is the main entrypoint for the
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet DispatcherServlet}
 * which delegates requests to controllers. This method - and also this interface -
 * should preferrably not be implemented by custom controllers <i>directly</i>, since
 * abstract controller also provided by this package already provide a lot
 * of functionality common for virtually all webapplications. A few examples of
 * those abstract controllers:
 * {@link AbstractController AbstractController},
 * {@link AbstractCommandController AbstractCommandController} and
 * {@link AbstractFormController AbstractFormController}.
 * </p>
 * <p>So basically any <i>direct</i> implementation of the Controller interface
 * just handles HttpServletRequests and should return a ModelAndView, to be
 * further used by the DispatcherServlet. Any additional functionality such
 * as optional validation, formhandling, etcetera should be obtained by
 * extended one of the abstract controller mentioned above.
 * </p>
