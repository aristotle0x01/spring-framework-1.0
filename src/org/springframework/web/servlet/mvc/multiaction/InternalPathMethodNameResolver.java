/**
 * Simple implementation of MethodNameResolver that maps URL to method
 * name. Although this is the default implementation used by the
 * MultiActionController class (because it requires no configuration),
 * it's bit naive for most applications. In particular, we don't usually
 * want to tie URL to implementation methods.
 *
 * <p>Maps the resource name after the last slash, ignoring an extension.
 * E.g. "/foo/bar/baz.html" to "baz", assuming a "/foo/bar/baz.html"
 * controller mapping to the respective MultiActionController.
 * Doesn't support wildcards.
