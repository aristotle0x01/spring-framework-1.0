    Standard controller implementations for the MVC framework that
    comes with Spring. Provides both abstract base classes and concrete implementations
    for often seen use cases.
</p>

<p>
    A <code>Controller</code> - as defined in this package - is analogous to a Struts
    <code>Action</code>. Usually <code>Controllers</code> are JavaBeans
    to allow easy configuration using the {@link org.springframework.beans org.springframework.beans}
    package. Controllers define the <code>C</code> from so-called MVC paradigm
    and can be used in conjunction with the {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView ModelAndView}
    to achieve interactive applications. The view might be represented by a
    HTML interface, but, because of model and the controller being completely
    independent of the view, PDF views are possible, as well as for instance Excel
    views.

    How to actually set up a (web)application using the MVC framework Spring
    provides is explained in more detail in the
    <a href="../../../../../../MVC-step-by-step/Spring-MVC-step-by-step.html">MVC-Step-by-Step
    tutorial</a>, also provided in this package (or have a look
    <a href="http://www.springframework.org">here</a> for an online version).
    The classes contained by this package explain in more detail the actual
    workflow of some of the abstract and concrete controller and how to extend
    and fully use their functionality.

<p>
    Especially useful to read, while getting into the Spring MVC framework
    are the following:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="Controller.html">Controller</a></li>
        <li><a href="SimpleFormController.html">BaseCommandController</a></li>
        <li><a href="ParameterizableViewController.html">ParameterizableViewController</a></li>
    </ul>
