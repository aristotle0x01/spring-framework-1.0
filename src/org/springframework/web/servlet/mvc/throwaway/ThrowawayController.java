/**
 * ThrowawayController is an alternative to Spring's default Controller interface,
 * for executable per-request command instances that are not aware of the Servlet API.
 * In contrast to Controller, implementing beans are not supposed to be defined as
 * Servlet/Struts-style singletons that process a HttpServletRequest but rather as
 * WebWork/Maverick-style prototypes that get populated with request parameters,
 * executed to determine a view, and thrown away afterwards.
 *
 * <p>The main advantage of this controller programming model is that controllers
 * are testable without HttpServletRequest/HttpServletResponse mocks, just like
 * WebWork actions. They are still web UI workflow controllers: Spring does not
 * aim for the arguably hard-to-achieve reusability of such controllers in non-web
 * environments, as XWork does (the generic command framework from WebWork2)
 * but just for ease of testing.
 *
 * <p>A ThrowawayController differs from the command notion of Base- respectively
 * AbstractCommandController in that a ThrowawayController is an <i>executable</i>
 * command that contains workflow logic to determine the next view to render,
 * while BaseCommandController treats commands as plain parameter holders.
 *
 * <p>If binding request parameters to this controller fails, a fatal BindException
 * will be thrown.
 *
 * <p>If you need access to the HttpServletRequest and/or HttpServletResponse,
 * consider implementing Controller or deriving from AbstractCommandController.
 * ThrowawayController is specifically intended for controllers that are not aware
 * of the Servlet API at all. Accordingly, if you need to handle session form objects
 * or even wizard forms, consider the corresponding Controller subclasses.
