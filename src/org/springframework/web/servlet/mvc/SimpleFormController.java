/**
 * <p>Concrete FormController implementation that provides configurable
 * form and success views, and an onSubmit chain for convenient overriding.</p>
 *
 * <p>Automatically resubmits to the form view in case of validation errors,
 * and renders the success view in case of a valid submission.</p>
 *
 * <p>The submit behavior can be customized by overriding one of the onSubmit
 * methods. Submit actions can be used as custom validation if necessary
 * (e.g. login), by calling showForm in case of validation errors.</p>
 *
 * <p>Besides some extra functionality like described above and in the
 * list of exposed configuration properties and the workflow description,
 * this class does the same as the {@link AbstractFormController AbstractFormController}
 * (hmmm, it also extends it).</p>
 *
 * <p><b><a name="workflow">Workflow
 * (<a href="BaseCommandController.html#workflow">and that defined by superclass</a>):</b><br>
 * The workflow of this Controller does not differ too much from the one described
 * in the {@link AbstractFormController AbstractFormController}, except for
 * the fact that overriding of the processFormSubmission method and the
 * showForm method is not necessary, since the view for the respective occasions
 * can be configured externally.
 * <ol>
 *  <li>XXX After validation of the command object and the perscribed
 *      call to {@link #onBindAndValidate onBindAndValidate} (for more
 *      information on that matter, see the AbstractFormController),
 *      the following:</li>
 *  <li>call to {@link #processFormSubmission processFormSubmission} which inspects the
 *      errors object to see if any errors are available (they could be inserted in
 *      the <code>bindAndValidate</code> method</li>
 *  <li>If errors occured, the controller will return the formView, giving
 *      the user the form again (with possible error message render accordingly)</li>
 *  <li>If no errors occurred, a call to
 *      {@link #onSubmit(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, Object, BindException) onSubmit()}
 *      using all parameters is done which (in case of the default implementation)
 *      calls {@link #onSubmit(Object) onSubmit()} with just the command object.
 *      This allows for convenient overriding of custom hooks</li>
 *  <li>After that has finished, the successView is returned (which again,
 *      is configurable through the exposed configuration properties)</li>
 *  </ol>
 * </p>
 *
