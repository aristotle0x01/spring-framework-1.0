/**
 * JavaBean to configure Velocity for web usage, via the "configLocation"
 * and/or "velocityProperties" and/or "resourceLoaderPath" bean properties.
 * The simplest way to use this class is to specify just a "resourceLoaderPath":
 * You do not need any further configuration then.
 *
 * <p><code>
 * &lt;bean id="velocityConfig" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.velocity.VelocityConfigurer"&gt;<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;property name="resourceLoaderPath"&gt;&lt;value&gt;/WEB-INF/velocity/&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;<br>
 * &lt;/bean&gt;
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>This bean must be included in the application context of any application
 * using Spring's VelocityView for web MVC. It exists purely to configure Velocity.
 * It is not meant to be referenced by application components but just internally
 * by VelocityView. Implements VelocityConfig to be found by VelocityView without
 * depending on the bean name the configurer. Each DispatcherServlet can define its
 * own VelocityConfigurer if desired.
 *
 * <p>Note that you can also refer to a preconfigured VelocityEngine instance, for
 * example one set up by VelocityEngineFactoryBean, via the "velocityEngine" property.
 * This allows to shared a VelocityEngine for web and email usage, for example.
