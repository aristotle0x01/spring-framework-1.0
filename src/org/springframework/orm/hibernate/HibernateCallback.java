/**
 * Callback interface for Hibernate code. To be used with HibernateTemplate's execute
 * method, assumably often as anonymous classes within a method implementation.
 * The typical implementation will call Session.load/find/save/update to perform
 * some operations on persistent objects. It can also perform direct JDBC operations
 * via Hibernate's Session.connection() method, returning the active JDBC connection.
 *
 * <p>Note that Hibernate works on unmodified plain Java objects, performing dirty
 * detection via copies made at load time. Returned objects can thus be used outside
 * of an active Hibernate Session without any hassle, e.g. for display in a web GUI.
 * Reassociating such instances with a new Session, e.g. for updates when coming
 * back from the GUI, is straightforward, as the instance has kept its identity.
 * You should care to reassociate them as early as possible though, to avoid having
 * already loaded a version from the database in the same Session.
