/**
 * Strategy that encapsulates certain functionality that standard JDO 1.0 does not offer
 * despite being relevant in the context of O/R mapping, like access to the underlying
 * JDBC connection and explicit flushing of changes to the database.
 *
 * <p>To be implemented for specific JDO implementations like Kodo, Lido, or JDO Genie.
 * Almost every O/R-based JDO implementation will offer proprietary means to access the
 * underlying JDBC Connection and to explicitly flush changes. JDO 2.0 respectively
 * JDO/R 2.0 are likely to define standard ways for these: If applicable, a JdoDialect
 * implementation for JDO 2.0 will be provided to leverage them with Spring's JDO support.
