/**
 * Helper class that simplifies JDO data access code, and converts
 * JDOExceptions into JdoUsage/JdoSystemException, compatible to the
 * org.springframework.dao exception hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>The central method is "execute", supporting JDO code implementing
 * the JdoCallback interface. It provides JDO PersistenceManager handling
 * such that neither theJdoCallback implementation nor the calling code
 * needs to explicitly care about retrieving/closing PersistenceManagers,
 * or handling JDO lifecycle exceptions.
 *
 * <p>Typically used to implement data access or business logic services that
 * use JDO within their implementation but are JDO-agnostic in their interface.
 * The latter resp. code calling the latter only have to deal with business
 * objects, query objects, and org.springframework.dao exceptions.
 *
 * <p>Can be used within a service implementation via direct instantiation
 * with a PersistenceManagerFactory reference, or get prepared in an
 * application context and given to services as bean reference.
 * Note: The PersistenceManagerFactory should always be configured as bean in
 * the application context, in the first case given to the service directly,
 * in the second case to the prepared template.
 *
 * <p>This class can be considered a programmatic alternative to
 * JdoInterceptor. The major advantage is its straightforwardness, the
 * major disadvantage that no checked application exceptions can get thrown
 * from within data access code. Respective checks and the actual throwing of
 * such exceptions can often be deferred to after callback execution, though.
 *
 * <p>Note that even if JdoTransactionManager is used for transaction
 * demarcation in higher-level services, all those services above the data
 * access layer don't need need to be JDO-aware. Setting such a special
 * PlatformTransactionManager is a configuration issue, without introducing
 * code dependencies.
 *
 * <p>LocalPersistenceManagerFactoryBean is the preferred way of obtaining a
 * reference to a specific PersistenceManagerFactory, at least in a non-EJB
 * environment. Registering a PersistenceManagerFactory with JNDI is only
 * advisable when using a JCA Connector, i.e. when the application server
 * cares for initialization. Else, portability is rather limited: Manual
 * JNDI binding isn't supported by some application servers (e.g. Tomcat).
