	 * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by
	 * DataSourceTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the

	 * a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC connection and thus the callback code
	 * will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.

	 * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
	 * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's
	 * special support for single step actions: see SqlMapClientTemplate.
	 * A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception, it gets
	 * propagated to the caller of the template.
