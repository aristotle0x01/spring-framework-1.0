 * Callback interface for data access code that works on an iBATIS Database Layer

 * often as anonymous classes within a method implementation.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: The SqlMap/MappedStatement API is the one to use with iBATIS SQL Maps 1.x.
 * The SqlMapClient/SqlMapSession API is only available with SQL Maps 2.

	/**
	 * Gets called by SqlMapTemplate.execute with an active JDBC Connection. Does not
	 * need to care about the lifecycle of the Connection or handling transactions.
	 *
	 * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by
	 * DataSourceTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the
	 * underlying JDBC connection with its transactional semantics. If using
	 * a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC connection and thus the callback code
	 * will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.
	 *
	 * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
	 * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's
	 * special support for single step actions: see SqlMapTemplate.
	 * A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception, it gets
	 * propagated to the caller of the template.
	 *
