/**
 * FactoryBean that looks up a JNDI object. Behaves like the object when
 * used as bean reference, e.g. for JdbcTemplate's dataSource property.
 *
 * <p>The typical usage will be to register this as singleton factory
 * (e.g. for a certain JNDI DataSource) in an application context,
 * and give bean references to application services that need it.
 *
 * <p>Of course, service implementations can lookup e.g. a DataSource from
 * JNDI themselves, but this class enables central configuration of the
 * JNDI name, and easy switching to non-JNDI replacements. The latter can
 * be used for test setups, standalone clients, etc.
 *
 * <p>Note that switching to e.g. DriverManagerDataSource is just a matter
 * of configuration: replace the definition of this FactoryBean with a
 * DriverManagerDataSource definition!
