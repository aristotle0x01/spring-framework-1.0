/**
 * <p>Convenient factory for local Stateless Session Bean (SLSB) proxies.
 * If you want control over interceptor chaining, use an AOP ProxyFactoryBean
 * with LocalSlsbInvokerInterceptor rather than rely on this class.
 * 
 * <p>See {@link org.springframework.jndi.AbstractJndiLocator} for info on
 * how to specify the JNDI location of the target EJB.
 * 
 * <p>In a bean container, this class is normally best used as a singleton. However,
 * if that bean container pre-instantiates singletons (as do the XML ApplicationContext
 * variants) you may have a problem if the bean container is loaded before the EJB
 * container loads the target EJB. That is because the JNDI lookup will be performed in
 * the init method of this class and cached, but the EJB will not have been bound at the
 * target location yet. The solution is to not pre-instantiate this factory object, but
 * allow it to be created on first use. In the XML containers, this is controlled via
 * the "lazy-init" attribute.
