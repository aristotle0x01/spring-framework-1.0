 * Convenient superclass for stateful session beans.
 * SFSBs should extend this class, leaving them to implement the
 * ejbActivate() and ejbPassivate() lifecycle methods to comply
 * with the requirements of the EJB specification.
 *
 * <p><b>Note: Subclasses should invoke the loadBeanFactory() method in
 * their custom ejbCreate and ejbActivate methods, and should invoke
 * the unloadBeanFactory() method in their ejbPassivate method.</b>
 * 
 * <p><b>Note: The default BeanFactoryLocator used by this class's superclass
 * (ContextJndiBeanFactoryLocator) is <b>not</b> serializable. Therefore,
 * when using the default BeanFactoryLocator, or another variant which is
 * not serializable, subclasses must call setBeanFactoryLocator(null) in
 * ejbPassivate, with a corresponding call to setBeanFactoryLocator(xxx)
 * in ejbActivate unless relying on the default locator.
