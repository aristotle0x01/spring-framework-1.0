Superclasses to make implementing EJBs simpler and less error-prone,
as well as guaranteeing a Spring BeanFactory is available
to EJBs. This promotes good practice, with EJB services used
for transaction management, thread management, and (possibly) remoting,
while business logic is implemented in easily testable POJOs.
<br>
In this model, the EJB is a facade, with as many POJO helpers behind
the BeanFactory as are required.

<br>

The classes in this package are discussed in Chapter 11 of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764543857/">Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development</a>
by Rod Johnson (Wrox, 2002).

The present version has changed somewhat, but has the same goals.

<p>
Note that the default behaviour is to look for an EJB enviroment variable
with name <code>ejb/BeanFactoryPath</code> that specifies the
location <i>on the classpath</i> of an XML bean factory definition
file (such as <code>/com/mycom/mypackage/mybeans.xml</code>.
If this JNDI key is missing, your EJB subclass won't
successfully initialize in the container.
