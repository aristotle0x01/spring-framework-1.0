AOP-based solution for declarative transaction demarcation.
Builds on the AOP infrastructure in org.springframework.aop.framework.
Any POJO can be transactionally advised with Spring.
<br>
The TransactionFactoryProxyBean can be used to create transactional AOP
proxies transparently to code that uses them.
<br>
The TransactionInterceptor is the AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor that delivers
transactional advice, based on the Spring transaction abstraction.
This allows declarative transaction management without JTA if an application
uses only a single database. 
<br>
If you require programmatic rollback, call the setRollbackOnly() method on the
TransactionStatus object returned from the TransactionInterceptor's static
currentTransactionStatus() method. Invoking this method outside a Spring
transactionally advised AOP invocation is a programming error and will result in
a runtime exception.
