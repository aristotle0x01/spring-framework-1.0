 * This is the central interface in Spring's transaction support.
 * Applications can use this directly, but it is not primarily meant as API.
 * Typically, applications will work with either TransactionTemplate or the
 * AOP transaction interceptor.
 *
 * <p>For implementers, AbstractPlatformTransactionManager is a good starting
 * point. The default implementations are DataSourceTransactionManager and
 * JtaTransactionManager.
