/**
 * Web controller that exports the specified service bean as Burlap service
 * endpoint, accessible via a Burlap proxy.
 *
 * <p>Burlap is a slim, XML-based RPC protocol.
 * For information on Burlap, see the
 * <a href="http://www.caucho.com/burlap">Burlap website</a>
 *
 * <p>This exporter will work with both Burlap 2.x and 3.x (respectively
 * Resin 2.x and 3.x), auto-detecting the corresponding skeleton class.
 *
 * <p>Note: Burlap services exported with this class can be accessed by
 * any Burlap client, as there isn't any special handling involved.
