/**
 * Part of a Pointcut. Checks whether the target method is eligible for advice.
 *
 * <p>A MethodMatcher may be evaluated <b>statically</b> or at <b>runtime</b> (dynamically).
 * Static matching involves method and (possibly) method attributes. Dynamic matching
 * also makes arguments for a particular call available, and any effects of running
 * previous advice applying to the joinpoint.
 *
 * <p>If an implementation returns false in its isRuntime() method, evaluation can be performed
 * statically, and the result will be the same for all invocations of this method,
 * whatever their arguments. If the isRuntime() method returns false, the 3-arg matches()
 * method will never be invoked.
 *
 * <p>If an implementation returns true in its 2-arg matches() method, and its isRuntime()
 * method returns true, the 3-argument matches() method will be invoked <i>immediately before
 * each potential execution of the related advice</i>, to decide whether the advice should run.
 * All previous advice, such as earlier interceptors in an interceptor chain, will have run,
 * so any state changes they have produced in parameters or ThreadLocal state, will be
 * available at the time of evaluation.
