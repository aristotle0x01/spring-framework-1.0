/**
 * A TargetSource is used to obtain the current "target" of 
 * an AOP invocation, which will be invoked via reflection if no
 * around advice chooses to end the interceptor chain itself. 
 * <br>If a TargetSource is "static", it will always
 * return the same target, allowing optimizations in the AOP framework.
 * Dynamic target sources can support pooling, hot swapping etc.
 * <br>Application developers don't usually need to work with TargetSources
 * directly: this is an AOP framework interface.
