/**
 * Class containing static methods used to obtain information about the
 * current AOP invocation. 
 * <p>
 * The currentProxy() method is usable if the AOP framework is configured
 * to expose the current proxy (not the default). It returns the AOP proxy in 
 * use. Target objects or advice can use this to make advised calls, in the same way 
 * as getEJBObject() can be used in EJBs. They can also use it to find advice
 * configuration.
 * <p>
 * The AOP framework does not expose proxies by default, as there is a performance cost 
 * in doing so.
 *
 * <p>The functionality in this class might be used by a target object
 * that needed access to resources on the invocation. However, this
 * approach should not be used when there is a reasonable alternative,
 * as it makes application code dependent on usage under AOP and
 * the Spring AOP framework.
