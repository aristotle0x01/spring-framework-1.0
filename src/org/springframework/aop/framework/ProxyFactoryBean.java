/**
 * FactoryBean implementation for use to source AOP proxies from a Spring BeanFactory.
 *
 * <p>Interceptors and Advisors are identified by a list of bean names in the current
 * bean factory. These beans should be of type Interceptor or Advisor. The last entry
 * in the list can be the name of any bean in the factory. If it's neither an
 * Interceptor nor an Advisor, a new SingletonTargetSource is added to wrap it.
 *
 * <p>Global interceptors and advisors can be added at the factory level. The specified
 * ones are expanded in an interceptor list where an "xxx*" entry is included in the
 * list, matching the given prefix with the bean names (e.g. "global*" would match
 * both "globalBean1" and "globalBean2", "*" all defined interceptors). The matching
 * interceptors get applied according to their returned order value, if they
 * implement the Ordered interface. An interceptor name list may not conclude
 * with a global "xxx*" pattern, as global interceptors cannot invoke targets.
 *
 * <p>Creates a J2SE proxy when proxy interfaces are given, a CGLIB proxy for the
 * actual target class if not. Note that the latter will only work if the target class
 * does not have final methods, as a dynamic subclass will be created at runtime.
 *
 * <p>It's possible to cast a proxy obtained from this factory to Advisor, or to
 * obtain the ProxyFactoryBean reference and programmatically manipulate it.
 * This won't work for existing prototype references, which are independent. However,
 * it will work for prototypes subsequently obtained from the factory. Changes to
 * interception will work immediately on singletons (including existing references).
 * However, to change interfaces or target it's necessary to obtain a new instance
 * from the factory. This means that singleton instances obtained from the factory
 * do not have the same object identity. However, they do have the same interceptors
 * and target, and changing any reference will change all objects.
