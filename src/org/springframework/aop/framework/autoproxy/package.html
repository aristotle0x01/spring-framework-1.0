Bean post processors for use in ApplicationContexts to simplify AOP usage
by automatically creating AOP proxies without the need to use a ProxyFactoryBean.
<br>
The various post processors in this package need only be added to an ApplicationContext--
typically in an XML bean definition document--to automatically proxy selected beans.
<br>
<b>NB</b>: autoproxying is not supported for BeanFactory implementations, as post-processing
is automatic only for application contexts.
