/**
 * Abstract uperclass for pooling TargetSources that maintains a pool of target instances, 
 * acquiring and releasing a target object from the pool for each method invocation. 
 * This class is independent of pooling technology.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must implement the getTarget() and releaseTarget() methods
 * to work with their chosen pool. The newPrototypeInstance() method 
 * inherited from AbstractPrototypeTargetSource can be used to create objects 
 * to put in the pool. Subclasses must also implement some of the monitoring methods
 * from the PoolingConfig interface. This class provides the getPoolingConfigMixin()
 * method to return an IntroductionAdvisor making these stats available on proxied
 * objects.
 * <p>
 * This class implements DisposableBean to force subclasses to implement
 * a destroy() method to close down their pool.
