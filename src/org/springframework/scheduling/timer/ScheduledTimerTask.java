/**
 * JavaBean that describes a scheduled TimerTask, consisting of
 * the TimerTask itself and a delay plus period. Period needs to
 * be specified; there is no point in a default for it.
 *
 * <p>The J2SE Timer does not offer more sophisticated scheduling
 * options like cron expressions. Consider using Quartz for such
 * demanding needs.
 *
 * <p>Note that Timer uses a TimerTask instance that is shared
 * between repeated executions, in contrast to Quartz which
 * instantiates a new Job for each execution.
