 * Interface to be implemented by Quartz Triggers that are aware

 * <p>SchedulerFactoryBean will auto-detect Triggers that implement this
 * interface and register them for the respective JobDetail accordingly.
 *
 * <p>The alternative is to configure a Trigger for a Job name and group:
 * This involves the need to register the JobDetail object separately
 * with SchedulerFactoryBean.
