/**
 * Simple implementation of the Quartz Job interface, applying the
 * passed-in job data map as bean property values. This is appropriate
 * because a new Job instance will be created for each execution.
 *
 * <p>For example, let's assume that the job data map contains a key
 * "myParam" with value "5": The Job implementation can then expose
 * a bean property "myParam" of type int to receive such a value,
 * i.e. a method "setMyParam(int)". This will also work for complex
 * types like business objects etc.
