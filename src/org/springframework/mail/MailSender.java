/**
 * This interface defines a strategy for sending simple mails. Can be
 * implemented for a variety of mailing systems due to the simple requirements.
 * For richer functionality like MIME messages, consider JavaMailSender.
 *
 * <p>Allows for easy testing of clients, as it does not depend on JavaMail's
 * infrastructure classes: no mocking of JavaMail Session or Transport necessary.
