/**
 * Extended MailSender interface for JavaMail, supporting MIME messages both as
 * direct arguments and via preparation callbacks.
 *
 * <p>Not as easy to test as a plain MailSender, but still rather easy compared
 * to full JavaMail code: Just let createMimeMessage return a plain MimeMessage
 * created with a Session.getInstance (empty properties) call, and check
 * the given messages in your mock implementations of the various send methods.
 *
 * <p>The recommended way of using this class is the MimeMessagePreparator
 * mechanism, possibly using a MimeMessageHelper for populating the message.
 * See MimeMessageHelper's javadoc for an example.
